== SPI ==

The following steps should be completed in the root directory of your apoc-spi local repository branch.

Before to continue, make sure you have all the dependencies requeried by this package:

 * Java SE JDK 1.4 or higher (http://www.java.com)
 * The autotools set (autoconf, automake and libtool)
 * Apache ANT (http://ant.apache.org/)
 * Mozilla (former Netscape's) Directory SDK for Java 
   (http://www.mozilla.org/directory/javasdk.html)

- Step 1: Generating the configure script - 
-------------------------------------------

NOTE: Tarball releases already include a configure script so this step is unnecessary in that case.

$ ./autogen.sh --help

If no errors occur, the configure script will be generated successfully and its help output would be shown.

- Step 2: Calling the configure script -
----------------------------------------

In the root path of the source code, you should execute the configure script. For more information on changing the default paths, execute configure with the --help option.

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-ns-ldap-path=/path/to/ldapjdk.jar

NOTE: We assume here that java, javac and ant are in the binary path. The ldapjdk.jar would be looked by default on /usr/share/lib/apoc/ldapjdk.jar, it can be located elsewhere, use the --with-ns-ldap-path option used in the example for any other location.

- Step 3: Building the sources -
--------------------------------

If the configuration ends successfully, then you should build and install the sources:

$ make
$ make install


Once complete, the SPI jar file, spi.jar should be available under your prefix directory as share/lib/apoc/spi.jar.
